XblAchievements
===============

This project contains XML files with information about Xbox Live achievements, particularly those that are hidden.

These files can be used while working with data returned by the unofficial Xbox Live APIs.

For API wrappers see my other projects:

How to contribute
====

Am I missing information? Of course I am! If you'd to contribute:

1. Use of the unofficial Xbox Live APIs to pull games with hidden achievements.
2. Create a new XML file for each game that you want to contribute (or open one of the existing ones).
3. If creating a new XML file, grab the game id and title from the Xbox APIs.
4. Create a new Achievement for each hidden achievement that needs to be documented. (Please put these in order of the achievement's id, from lowest to highest.)
5. Pull up the game's page on the official site - for example https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Activity/Details?titleId=1397819364 - and copy and paste the title, description, and tile URL for each hidden achievement that you've unlocked.
6. Save and commit your changes, and I'll get them added as soon as possible.
